A simple GUI-based quiz game developed by three members for the assignment. The player enters their name, chooses a quiz topic (Python, General Knowledge, Sports, or Interesting Topic), answers multiple-choice questions, and receives a score and feedback at the end. The game features an eye-catching Tkinter interface and modular code for easy explanation and teamwork.

## Features

- Player name entry
- Topic selection (Python, General Knowledge, Sports, Interesting Topic)
- Multiple-choice questions for each topic
- Randomized questions and options
- Countdown timer with visual updates
- Smooth fade-in and slide-in animations
- Score calculation and feedback
- Restart and exit options
- User-friendly, colorful GUI

## Project Structure

- `main.py` — Main entry point, manages game flow and connects GUI and logic
- `gui.py` — Handles GUI display and user interaction
- `quiz_data.py` — Contains quiz questions, scoring, and feedback functions

## How To Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Download all three files: `main.py`, `gui.py`, and `quiz_data.py` into the same folder.
3. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
python main.py
```

4. Enjoy the quiz game!

## How The Code Is Divided

- **Member 1**: Prepares questions and scoring logic in `quiz_data.py`
- **Member 2**: Designs and manages the GUI in `gui.py`
- **Member 3**: Connects everything and runs the game in `main.py`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses built-in `tkinter`)
